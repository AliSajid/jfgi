# Code of Conduct

## The Golden Rule

Don't be a jerk. This is a fun project, so let's keep it that way.

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of who they are, where they're from, or what search engine they prefer (but really, Google).

## Our Standards

Examples of awesome behavior include:

- Writing clean, meme-worthy code.
- Being kind and constructive in discussions, even if someone suggests using Bing.
- Helping others improve their code, one sarcastic comment at a time.

Examples of not-so-awesome behavior include:

- Personal attacks or name-calling.
- Spamming the repo with nonsense issues or PRs.
- Adding links to Yahoo or Ask Jeeves without a compelling reason (kidding, but alsoâ€¦ don't).

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within our repository, issue tracker, pull requests, and any related public forums. If you're interacting with this project, these rules apply.

## Enforcement

If someone violates this Code of Conduct, here's what we'll do:

1. Politely (or humorously) ask them to knock it off.
2. If the behavior continues, they'll be banned faster than you can say, "Just Google it."

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant, with a healthy dose of humor thrown in for good measure.

Thank you for being excellent to each other!
