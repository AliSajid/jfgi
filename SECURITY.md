## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you find a security vulnerability, congratulations! You're probably more careful than anyone else who has ever used this site.

Please email us at [asimami@imamiland.com](mailto:asimami@imamiland.com) to report the issue. We'll address it as quickly as we can, assuming we're not too busy Googling things ourselves.

## Data Collection Policy

This is a harmless little website designed to make you chuckle and, occasionally, redirect you to Google. Here's what we _don't_ do:

- **No Ads**: You won't find any here.
- **No User Data**: We don't collect or store anything about you. Seriously, nothing.
- **Google Analytics**: We do use Google Analytics, but we only look at aggregate stats like how many people have visited and which memes are most popular. No identifying information is collected or retained.

That's it. Stay safe out there, and remember: in case of questions, Just Fucking Google it.
