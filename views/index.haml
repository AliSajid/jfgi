   Someone thinks you are an idiot because you were too stupid to check
   %a{:href => "http://www.google.com"} Google 
   before asking a question. They gave you a link to this site as a joke.  The fact that you followed it pretty much proves the point.
      
  %p
   Hope that helps.

   Have a nice day.

    WARNING: SITE ABUSES
       
  %p   
   It has come to my attention that some sites are redirecting to this one when their users were not expecting it.  I have <em>no</em> control over this. The only sites I have control over that have anything to do with this site are justfuckinggoogleit.com, www.justfuckinggoogleit.com, fuckinggoogleit.com, and www.fuckinggoogleit.com.  If any other site is sending you here, it is <em>their</em> problem, not mine.  They may have been hacked, or they may be playing a joke.  I don't know, and I can't do anything about it.  Please stop sending me e-mail about this issue.
  
  %p
   Please direct abuse reports or server problems to 
   %a{:href => "mailto:webmaster@justfuckinggoogleit.com"} webmaster@justfuckinggoogleit.com
   
  %p
   %a{:href => "http://www.google.com"} Google does not endorse this site, and is not associated with it in any way whatsoever.
   
  %p
   I have added an 
   %a{:href => "info"} information page
     
  %p
   / Archives of mail sent to this site can be found at 
   / http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com/mail/
   / This is the easter egg.
   
  %p
   By the way, http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com/search/foo bar will show this page and then redirect users to the Google page for searching on "foo bar", as will many other variants.
