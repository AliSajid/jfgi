# Contributing to Just F**\*\*** Google It

Thank you for considering contributing to this ridiculous yet oddly useful project! Here's how you can help us make it even better.

## Standards We Pretend to Enforce

- **Code Style**: We use TypeScript and follow standard conventions enforced by `eslint` and `prettier`. You don't have to guess—just let our tools do the nagging.
- **Pre-Commit Hooks**: Messy code? Not on our watch. Pre-commit hooks will format your code before you even get the chance to embarrass yourself.
- **Continuous Integration**: Your code will be tested, linted, and possibly judged by a robotic overlord (GitHub Actions).

## What We're Looking For

1. **Memes**: Got a hilarious image idea for the timer? Send it our way!
2. **Accessibility**: Help us ensure everyone can enjoy the site, regardless of abilities.
3. **Optimizations**: Mobile, performance, Lighthouse scores—if you can improve them, we'll love you forever.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repo**: Because everyone else does.
1. **Clone It Locally**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AliSajid/jfgi.git
   cd jfgi
   ```

1. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
# We use pnpm for dependency management

pnpm i

```

1. **Do Your Thing**: Code, test, and laugh at your own jokes.

1. **Run Tests**:

```bash
# Add tests for your addition as well

pnpm test
```

1. **Open a Pull Request**: Explain your changes, keep it brief, and throw in a meme if you're feeling sassy.

## What Not to Do

- Don't break things. (Seriously, we have CI to stop you, but let's not make it work too hard.)
- Don't spam us with nonsense PRs. If you do, we'll just Google you and laugh.

## Communication

Feel free to open an issue for discussions or clarifications. We'll reply as soon as we stop laughing at how awesome this project is.

Thank you for helping us make this a fun and useful tool for the internet!
