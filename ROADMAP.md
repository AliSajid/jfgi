# Roadmap

## Current Status

The web application is **feature complete**, delivering on its core promise:

- A timer and redirect mechanism that guides people toward Google.
- A few (three, for now) hilarious meme images to brighten your (or your target's) day before redirecting.

## Future Enhancements

While the website works just fine, there's always room for a little polish. Here's what we might add in the future:

1. **More Meme Images**: Because three is good, but five is better.
2. **Mobile Optimizations**: Boost Lighthouse scores to impress that one person who always checks.
3. **Accessibility Updates**: Ensure everyone can enjoy the laughs (and the redirects).

## No Grand Vision

Let's be honest: This project doesn't need a ten-year plan. It's a lighthearted, simple tool. But if you have ideas for improvement, we're all ears! Submit an issue or PR, and we'll take a look.

## Past Milestones

- **Version 3.0**: Rebuilt from the ground up using Svelte, Firebase, and Vercel. Faster, leaner, and meaner.
- **Version 2.0**: Ruby/Sinatra/Postgres era, hosted on Heroku. Introduced tracking for unique visits.
- **Version 1.0**: The original Perl script, simple and effective.
