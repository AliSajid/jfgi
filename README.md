Have you ever been baffled by someone's inability to use Google? Do you wish there was a way to nudge them in the right direction without resorting to sarcasm? Well, now there is! **Just fucking Google It** is a simple website for redirecting clueless questions into enlightening Google searches.

## Features

- **Blazing Fast**: Built with Svelte and hosted on Vercel for speedy redirects.
- **Zero Hassle**: No ads, no tracking, no nonsense (except Google Analytics aggregates).
- **Humorous Memes**: Includes a timer with hilarious[^1] images to encourage self-sufficiency.
- **Multiple Domains**: Use whichever URL rolls off your tongue best.

## History

This is the third incarnation of the project:

1. **Perl Era**: The OG version was a simple Perl script that worked as a straightforward redirecting landing page.
2. **Ruby/Sinatra/Postgres Era**: A second version introduced some analytics (storing unique visits in a PostgreSQL database). It was hosted on Heroku but became expensive to maintain.
3. **Svelte/Firebase Era**: Today's version is powered by Svelte and Firebase for simplicity and speed. Hosted on Vercel, it's lighter, faster, and doesn't store any user data.

## How to Use

  [https://fuckinggoogleit.com/what+is+the+meaning+of+life](https://fuckinggoogleit.com/what+is+the+meaning+of+life)
- Share the link with someone who needs a nudge (or shove) toward self-sufficiency.
