# Governance

Welcome to the wonderful bureaucracy of **Just F\*\*\*\*** Google It\*\*. Here's how decisions are made around here.

## Project Ownership

- **Original Creator**: Robin Powell dreamed up this project and still owns the domains. Without him, this website wouldn't exist (literally).
- **Current Maintainer**: Ali Sajid Imami (that's me!) handles all the technical stuff and day-to-day updates.

## Decision-Making Process

1. **Technical Decisions**: Ali (me) gets the final say on all technical matters. I promise not to abuse this power (too much).
2. **Domain-Related Decisions**: If there's a dispute about the project that I can't resolve, Robin Powell has the final word. After all, possession is nine-tenths of the law—or the internet.

## Community Contributions

While this project is pretty straightforward, we're happy to consider contributions! If you want to add more memes, improve accessibility, or boost performance, please check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts should be rare, but if they arise:

1. Be civil (no need for fisticuffs—this isn't the Wild West).
2. If a technical dispute arises, we'll try to reach consensus.
3. If we can't agree, Robin has the final say because he owns the domains.

Thanks for being part of the journey, whether you're contributing code or just chuckling at our memes.
